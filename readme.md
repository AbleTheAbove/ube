# bark blocks

block engine built on top of my bark graphical application framework in zig

- zig 0.7.1
- opengl 4.5
- glad
- glfw

currently only windows is supported. linux is the next on the target list

## building
1. clone the repo and cd into it
2. `$ zig run buildres.zig`
3. `$ zig build run`

## contributing

this is really more of a personal project atm, but if you have ideas open an issue, submit a pr or contact me! you can often find me on the zig discord server.
